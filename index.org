#+title: Mapgen1 with hexagons

#+draft: t

I wanted to procedurally generate a wilderness map on a hexagonal grid. I already have the ingredients for this: [[https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/][mapgen1]], [[https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/][hexagonal grids]], [[https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/parts/#hexagon-coordinates][edge coordinates]], but I haven't put these ingredients together in this way before.

Source: [[file:mapgen1-hexagons.ts]]

Ingredients used so far:

1. hexlib.js from https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html#codegen
1. hex grid from https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html#map-shapes
1. store attributes at each hex - KeyMap class from https://www.redblobgames.com/x/2226-roguelike-dev/
1. hex to x,y from hexToPixel() https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#hex-to-pixel
1. x,y to e,m from https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/#demo
1. e,m to biome from https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/#biomes
1. biome to color from https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/mapgen2/colormap.js
1. drawing each hex from https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/mapgen2/draw.js
1. make the maps into islands using https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/#islands
1. click/drag handler https://www.redblobgames.com/making-of/draggable/examples.html#svg-painting
1. find hex to paint on https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#pixel-to-hex

Ingredients for later:

1. add icons for biomes from https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/mapgen2/map-icons.html
1. edge coordinates from https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/parts/#hexagon-coordinates
1. mark edges as coastlines, and draw them
1. generate rivers, and draw them
1. generate or paint roads, and draw them
1. have a separate notion of temperature and elevation, so that snow could be at low elevation in arctic regions
