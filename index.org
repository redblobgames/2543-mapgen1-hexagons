I wanted to procedurally generate a wilderness map on a hexagonal grid. I already have the ingredients for this: [[https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/][mapgen1]], [[https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/][hexagonal grids]], [[https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/parts/#hexagon-coordinates][edge coordinates]], but I haven't put these ingredients together in this way before.

Ingredients phase 1:

1. hexlib.js from https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html#codegen
1. hex grid from https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html#map-shapes
1. some way to store attributes of each hex tile
1. hex to x,y from hexToPixel() https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#hex-to-pixel
1. x,y to e,m from https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/#demo
1. e,m to biome from https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/#biomes
1. biome to color from colormap.js
1. drawing each hex
1. clicking on hexes using pixelToHex() https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#pixel-to-hex → see the tags

Phase 2:

1. edge coordinates from https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/parts/#hexagon-coordinates
1. coastline drawing + tag by marking edges that are coastlines
1. river generation
1. road click edge to toggle
